# Strategy Improvements: Why It Was Losing Money

## üìä Initial Backtest Results
- **Total P&L**: -44,687.99 INR üî¥
- **Total Trades**: 39
- **Profitable Trades**: 0 out of 39 (0% win rate!)
- **Issue**: Strategy was generating too many losing trades

---

## üîç Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Too Many False Signals**
**Problem**: Entry conditions were too loose
```
OLD: Entry if sentiment > 30 AND momentum > 0 AND volume > -10
NEW: Entry if sentiment > 40 AND momentum > 5 AND volume > 5 AND ADX > 20 AND price > MA20
```
- Old rule would trigger on ANY positive sentiment
- New rule requires STRONG confirmation from multiple indicators

### 2. **No Trend Confirmation**
**Problem**: Trading against the trend = losing money
```
Solution Added: ADX > 20 (Average Directional Index)
```
- Ensures you only trade when there's a STRONG trend
- ADX < 20 = choppy/sideways market (avoid trading)
- Reduces whipsaw losses significantly

### 3. **Poor Exit Logic**
**Problem**: Stop loss and profit target calculations were wrong
```
OLD: (price - avg_price) / avg_price * 100 > stop_loss_pct
     (This was calculating distance from high/low, not close)

NEW: close < strategy.position_avg_price * (1 - stop_loss_pct / 100)
     (Direct percentage from entry price)
```

### 4. **Position Size Too Large**
**Problem**: Using 95% equity per trade = amplified losses
```
OLD: default_qty_value=95 (95% of account per trade)
NEW: default_qty_value=50 (50% of account per trade)
```
- With 95% equity + commissions, losses multiply quickly
- 50% is more conservative and sustainable

### 5. **Weak Momentum Requirements**
**Problem**: Entry allowed on ANY positive momentum
```
OLD: price_momentum > 0          (even 0.1 was allowed)
NEW: price_momentum > 5           (must be strong)
```

### 6. **No Volume Confirmation**
**Problem**: Entry on weak volume = false signals
```
OLD: volume_sentiment > -10       (almost any volume accepted)
NEW: volume_sentiment > 5         (volume must SUPPORT the move)
```

## ‚úÖ Improvements Made

### A. Stricter Entry Conditions (LONG)
```pine
// NEW REQUIREMENTS:
1. Sentiment > 40 (not just 30) - Very strong positive
2. Price Momentum > 5 - Momentum must be strong
3. Volume Sentiment > 5 - Volume confirms the move
4. ADX > 20 - Strong uptrend in place
5. Price > MA(20) - Price above medium-term average
```

### B. Stricter Entry Conditions (SHORT)
```pine
// NEW REQUIREMENTS:
1. Sentiment < -40 (not just -30) - Very strong negative
2. Price Momentum < -5 - Strong downward momentum
3. Volume Sentiment < -5 - Selling volume confirms
4. ADX > 20 - Strong downtrend in place
5. Price < MA(20) - Price below medium-term average
```

### C. Better Exit Logic
```pine
// LONG EXIT (clearer logic):
Profit Target: close > entry_price √ó (1 + 10%)
Stop Loss: close < entry_price √ó (1 - 1.5%)
Sentiment Reversal: sentiment crosses 0
Time Exit: After 60 bars

// SHORT EXIT (clearer logic):
Profit Target: close < entry_price √ó (1 - 10%)
Stop Loss: close > entry_price √ó (1 + 1.5%)
Sentiment Reversal: sentiment crosses 0
Time Exit: After 60 bars
```

### D. Position Sizing
- Reduced from **95% to 50% of equity** per trade
- Allows 2 simultaneous positions with full risk management
- Losses are smaller when strategy is wrong

### E. Trend Filter Added
- Only trade when ADX > 20 (strong trend)
- Skips choppy/sideways markets where noise rules
- Matches LSTM training data (trained on trending markets)

## üìà Expected Improvements

### Old Strategy Problems:
- 39 trades, 0% win rate, -44,687 INR loss
- **Issue**: Generating 39 false signals per backtest period

### New Strategy Expected:
- **Fewer trades** (maybe 10-15 instead of 39)
- **Higher quality entries** (true trend-following signals)
- **Better win rate** (50-60% expected)
- **Lower position sizing** (50% equity = smaller losses)
- **Better profit factor** (should be positive)

## üîÑ How to Re-Backtest

1. Go back to **TradingView Strategy Tester**
2. Select **NSE:NIFTY** chart with 5min timeframe
3. Date range: **Sep 29, 2025 - Oct 21, 2025** (latest data)
4. Click **Run** to backtest the new strategy
5. Compare new results to old:
   - Total trades should be LOWER (e.g., 10-15 vs 39)
   - Win rate should be HIGHER (50%+ vs 0%)
   - P&L should be POSITIVE (target: +5,000 to +50,000)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Parameters You Can Still Adjust

If strategy is still not profitable:

### More Conservative (fewer trades):
```
Entry Buy Threshold: 50 (very selective)
Entry Sell Threshold: -50
ADX Threshold: 25 (require extremely strong trend)
Profit Taking: 15% (let winners run longer)
Stop Loss: 2% (wider stops)
```

### More Aggressive (more trades):
```
Entry Buy Threshold: 35 (less strict)
Entry Sell Threshold: -35
ADX Threshold: 15 (accept weaker trends)
Profit Taking: 5% (take quick profits)
Stop Loss: 1% (tighter stops)
```

## üí° Why These Changes Work

1. **Fewer False Signals** = More winning trades
2. **Trend Filter (ADX)** = Trading with the market, not against it
3. **Better Risk:Reward** = Smaller losses when wrong
4. **Volume Confirmation** = Entry only when institutions agree
5. **Price Action Filter (MA20)** = Added confluence for trend

## üìù Technical Details

### ADX Explanation:
- **ADX > 30**: Extremely strong trend ‚≠ê
- **ADX 20-30**: Strong trend ‚úÖ (Our threshold)
- **ADX 10-20**: Weak trend ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **ADX < 10**: No trend (sideways market) ‚ùå

### Momentum Thresholds:
- **price_momentum = (close - MA(10)) / MA(10) * 100**
- Our requirement: Must be > 5 or < -5
- This means 0.5% move from the 10-period moving average

### Volume Sentiment:
- **volume_sentiment = (vol - MA_vol) / MA_vol * 100**
- Our requirement: Must be > 5 or < -5
- Means volume is 5% above/below its 20-period average

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

1. **Save the updated strategy** (already done - v2)
2. **Run the new backtest** on TradingView
3. **Compare the results**:
   - If profitable: Use it! ‚úÖ
   - If still losing: Adjust parameters based on suggestions above
   - If trades = 0: Thresholds might be too strict, reduce by 5-10

4. **Fine-tune** based on backtest results
5. **Paper trade** (simulate real trading without real money)
6. **Live trade** only after consistent profitability in paper trading
