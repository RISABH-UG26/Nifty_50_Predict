# PineScript Strategy Guide: Sentiment-Driven LSTM Intraday Trading

## Overview

This PineScript strategy translates your Python LSTM sentiment model into an executable trading strategy for TradingView. It's designed for **intraday trading** on NIFTY 50 with sentiment-based entry/exit signals.

**File**: `Sentiment_LSTM_Intraday_Strategy.pine`

---

## 🎯 Strategy Summary

### Core Concept
Instead of complex LSTM neural networks (which TradingView doesn't natively support), this strategy uses a **weighted combination of technical indicators** to approximate LSTM sentiment scores:

1. **Price Momentum** (25% weight) - Captures price trend
2. **Volatility Sentiment** (20% weight) - Market fear/greed
3. **Volume Sentiment** (20% weight) - Institutional participation
4. **OHLC Pattern Strength** (20% weight) - Candle body strength
5. **Trend Sentiment** (15% weight) - Multi-timeframe alignment

### Sentiment Score
- Range: -100 to +100
- **Positive (>30)**: Strong buy signal
- **Negative (<-30)**: Strong sell signal
- **Neutral (-30 to 30)**: No signal

## 📈 Strategy Components

### 1. Sentiment Score Calculation

```
Sentiment = Σ(weight × indicator)
where indicators are:
  - Price Momentum
  - Volatility Sentiment
  - Volume Sentiment
  - OHLC Pattern Strength
  - Trend Sentiment
```

### 2. Entry Signals

#### BUY Signal:
```
IF (Sentiment > 30) AND (Momentum > 0) AND (Volume > -10)
→ LONG Entry
```

#### SELL Signal:
```
IF (Sentiment < -30) AND (Momentum < 0) AND (Volume < 10)
→ SHORT Entry
```

### 3. Exit Signals (Priority Order)

1. **Profit Target**: Exit at +10% (or configured %age)
2. **Stop Loss**: Exit at -1.5% (or configured %age)
3. **Sentiment Reversal**: Exit if sentiment crosses midpoint
4. **Time Exit**: Exit after 60 bars (or configured duration)

### 4. Visualization

On chart you'll see:
- **Blue Line**: Sentiment Score
- **Green Dashed**: Buy Threshold (30)
- **Red Dashed**: Sell Threshold (-30)
- **Gray Dotted**: Neutral (0)
- **Green Zone**: Buy area (sentiment > threshold)
- **Red Zone**: Sell area (sentiment < threshold)

### 5. Info Panel

Top-right corner shows real-time:
- Current Sentiment Score
- Price Momentum value
- Volume Sentiment
- Trend Sentiment
- Current Position (LONG/SHORT/NONE)
- Win Rate %
- Total Profit/Loss
- Current Equity

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: No Signals Generated
**Solution**:
- Check sentiment thresholds (too high?)
- Verify timeframe is 5min or 15min
- Check volume - may be low
- Adjust entry thresholds to 20 and -20

### Issue: Too Many False Signals
**Solution**:
- Increase entry thresholds to 40/-40
- Increase momentum period to 15-20
- Reduce weights on noisy indicators (volume)
- Add volume confirmation filter

### Issue: Stops Being Hit Too Often
**Solution**:
- Increase stop loss % (2-3%)
- Reduce profit target (easier to hit)
- Use 15min chart instead of 5min (fewer noise)
- Add ATR-based stops instead of fixed %

### Issue: Missing Big Moves
**Solution**:
- Decrease entry thresholds (20/-20)
- Increase weights on momentum
- Use 5min chart (more responsive)
- Add trend confirmation
